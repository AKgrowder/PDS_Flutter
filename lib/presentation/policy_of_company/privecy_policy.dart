                for the Products purchased using any of the payment methods we may occasionally make available on the
                Platform. However, it is important to note and is hereby made clear that we or the third party we have
                hired for this purpose will only act in a fiduciary capacity if the Retailer chooses to make payments
                through any such mode made available by us or any other party we have engaged for this purpose.
        <p style="font-family: Arial;  font-size: 16px;  ">b.Growder may charge the Retailer a convenience fee (including GST) for
                enabling the payment facility for the Retailer. The convenience fee (including GST) will be displayed on
                the payment page during checkout. Growder reserves the right to change the convenience fee at any time
                and without prior notice. Under no circumstances is this convenience fee refundable.

        <p style="font-family: Arial;  font-size: 16px;  ">c. We may, in our sole discretion, require Retailer to pay the full amount
                at the time the Order is placed to purchase Products from the OEM on the Platform. The entire sum shall
                be held in trust by us and shall not bear interest. If the Retailer cancels the Order after it has been
                marked "ready to ship" or the OEM designates the Order as an Undelivered Shipment as defined by the
                Undelivered Shipment Policy, we may, in our sole discretion, either:

        <p style="font-family: Arial;  font-size: 16px;  ">1. Deduct a ‘Cancellation Penalty Fee’ and refund the remaining Amount to
                the Retailer; or

                You agree that our judgment in this matter will be final and binding. You can decide not to conduct
                business on the Platform if you disagree with the aforementioned. It will be assumed that you have
                agreed to and accepted the aforementioned terms if you continue to transact on the Platform.
                </span></p>

        <p style="font-family: Arial;  font-size: 16px; ">d.
                Retailer acknowledges that it alone is accountable for the payments made to the OEM for the Products
                that Retailer has purchased. Retailer understands and agrees that we are only acting as a payment
                collector and that we shall have no liability for any payment transaction between the OEM and the
                Retailer. We are under no duty, obligation, or liability to check any transactions that the Retailer has
                authenticated and/or authorized, or to check its payment instructions.

        <p style="font-family: Arial;  font-size: 16px; ">e. In
                accordance with the settlement procedure outlined in the OEM Terms, we will transmit the payments for
                the Orders that we have acquired from the Retailer. You hereby agree to be bound by the applicable
                provisions of the OEM Terms in this regard and to refrain from raising any objections to Growder's
                method of dispute resolution.

        <p style="font-family: Arial;  font-size: 16px; ">f. In
                relation to making payments on the Platform, you hereby consent and agree to comply with any guidelines,
                instructions, requests, etc. that may be made by us, third-party banks or financial institutions, as the
                case may be, or a payment system provider from time to time.
        <p style="font-family: Arial;  font-size: 16px; ">g.
                Retailer acknowledges and agrees that we are not responsible for any transaction undertaken on the
                Platform that fails for any reason, including but not limited to OEM non-performance, omission, or
                commission, inadequacy of service and/or products delivered, and technical errors on the Platform. You
                further acknowledge that we shall not be liable, in any way, for any loss incurred by you as a result of
                a failed or unsuccessful transaction you conducted through the Platform.

        <p style="font-family: Arial;  font-size: 16px; ">h. If a
                chargeback event occurs, we reserve the right to delay paying OEMs while banks or other regulatory
                bodies look into the matter and until those problems are resolved.

        <p style="font-family: Arial;  font-size: 16px; ">i. The
                return shipment and undelivered shipment policies will apply to any refunds. The same way they are
                received, refunds must be processed in the same way. According to the policies of the respective banks,
                the refund amount will appear in the retailer's bank account.

        <p style="font-family: Arial;  font-size: 16px; ">j.If you
                use the Platform to use the services of any third party service provider, you agree and authorize us,

                payments to the third party service provider's designated bank account within the time frames specified
                in the OEM Terms, less any applicable taxes and our fees (if any). You acknowledge and agree that we
                won't need a separate authorization from you in order to collect and transfer funds to that third-party
                service provider.

                        You acknowledge that once the shipment is picked up by us, the risk and title in it will pass to

                        To be clear, the Retailer may not be the designated recipient. While we will get the recipient
                        of the shipment's signature on the Delivery Note, we won't check the identity of the person
                        receiving the shipment at the specified delivery address. The Retailer hereby grants us
                        permission to reach out to them at any time for transactional purposes, including but not
                        limited to order confirmations and/or delivering the Order(s), via calls, SMS, or any other form

                consideration of the platform provided by Growder to the OEM, the OEM will be required to pay a fee
                (re-ferred to as “Growder Fee” ) to Growder. It is hereby clarified that the Growder Fee shall be
                calculated on the total invoice value of the Order.
        <p style="font-family: Arial;  font-size: 16px; ">ii. The
                applicable Growder Fee shall be as Growder may from time to time communicate to the OEM(s) through the
                Platform or through such other method of commu-nication as Growder may determine in its sole
                discre-tion. The OEM shall be responsible for routinely verify-ing such Growder Fee. If you use the
                Platform in the future, it will be assumed that you have accepted the Growder Fee change.
        <p style="font-family: Arial;  font-size: 16px; ">iii.
                Growder will send the OEM an invoice for the Growder Fee, and the OEM will pay Growder for that invoice.
                OEM acknowledges that only the OEM shall be in charge of seeing that the Growder Fee is given to the
                Growder. OEM permits Growder to make adjustments and deduct such Growder Fees from amounts received or
                re-received from the Retailer in accordance with the settlement procedures outlined in the Payment and
                Settlement Services Agreement.
        <p style="font-family: Arial;  font-size: 16px; ">iv. The
                Growder Fee will be subject to any applicable taxes under current law. If required by applicable law,
                OEM shall deduct income tax as appropriate from Growder's payments, unless Growder submits a
                nil/re-duced withholding certificate. By supplying a proper and timely certificate of withholding as
                required by the relevant law, OEM shall remit the withholding taxes to the appropriate tax authorities
                and permit Growder to claim a tax credit.
        <p style="font-family: Arial;  font-size: 16px; "> v.
                Growder will bill the OEM extra fees for any extra ser-vices it offers or for services it does not
                include in the Growder platform. OEM hereby authorizes Growder to adjust the charges from the receivable
                that are due and payable to OEM by Growder. Growder shall be entitled to recover/deduct such additional
                charges from the amount collected or received by Growder from the Re-tailer. Such settlement shall be
                made in accordance with the settlement provision of the Payment and Set-tlement Services. Growder may
                enter into a separate

                agreement with the OEM to provide these additional services if Growder so desires.

                Growder reserves the right to impose penalties or late payment fees in the event that the OEM is late in

                orders. OEM gives Growder permission to adjust or deduct any penalties, late payment fees, or
                cancellation fees from the receivables Growder owes OEM. According to the settlement procedure outlined
                in the Payment and Set-tlement Services herein, such settlement will be carried out.
